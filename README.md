# weather-app-sheCodesPlus

Hello 👋🏾 At the end of Feb. 2021 I finished working 🛠 on my weather app for the SheCodes Plus course. 👩🏽‍💻 🎉
In the future I want to implement the following:

- Secure/Protect/Hide API Key
- Different themes/modes
- Convert forecast temp units to °C
- Toogle between showing min and max temps in the forecast
- Reintroducing the disabled link feature while addressing this bug:
  "Selecting ºC and searching for a new city will give the temperature in ºF, but the ºC link remains selected/active providing incorrect
  information."
